## Project Description 
---

Collectively as a group we pitched different ideas to each other, in response to the theme revolutionsing finance for 2023. A key challenge was being able to identify the ideas that would best marry up, with our time schedule. After realising some ideas would be overly ambitious, we concluded that there could be ingenuity in simplicity. 

Hitting upon our idea, we delved further into how we could ensure that we solved a **problem**, and we responded to this, with the implementation of our tech skills. We discussed how our potential target audience could be handling budgeting, at a time where our living standards are suffering, because of the cost of living and energy crisis. Everyone has had to be a bit more thrifty and cut back where they can. What we wish to achieve is a budgeting app, that uses visual representations, to enable the indiviudal to make better choices on how they spend and save their money, over a peroid of time. 

Initially the user will sign up to the application and take a personality test, this will allow a randomiser to generate user specific visuals from their answers. For instance over a peroid of a week how often does the user buy a cup of coffee, in turn this will generate the weekly cost in either sterling, dollars or euros. In order to have real time exchange values we will have to use an api, to interact with out application. 

### Concept 

---

Coding being logic based creativity allowed us to explore and critique our methods as we progressed through the project, we were able to utilise the huddle feature, on slack, to keep regular contact with the team, which allowed us to pursue our vision and concept in a uniformed way. We needed to keep asking who, what, why and how questions in order to achieve what we set out to do. 

Main conceptual points are as follows:

* Interact with our audience in a fun and engaging way, **times are hard** dont be too serious e.g. this could be represented by using a playful colour pallete and widgets.
* Ask questions to guage the individuals personality, we have decided to start with **10 questions** but if we had more development time we would certainly add more.
* Use a **progress bar** to give a visual representation to the user on the number of questions that need to be answered.
* By specifiying how much money the user wants to save the app will generate a response using visual representations of **life style spending habbits**. 
* Alerting the user to the fact that by **reducing** their **consumption** of for example coffee they will be able to save their desired amount of money over a **peroid of time**.





### Intention

---

Penny Smart aims to be marketed towards userbases, who use modern banking applications like **Monzo**, **Revolut** and **Starling**. These banks, allow for their users, to interact, with their budgetting needs. The application we aim to create, could be pitched to likes of these modern banks as a new way for their user bases's to interact with their app in a engaging way. 

### Audience

---

Our target audience would be those predominantly feeling the pinch, as a result of the cost of living crisis. Communicating in a fun and engaging way is key to how we will respond to our potential user basis's concerns and needs. Taking a less serious approach would act as ice breaker, making the world of finance feel a bit more digestable to the **every day joe**. Age range would vary between 18-30 year olds on average.
