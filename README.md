    With regards to the theme of the programme "Revolutionizing Finance", we thought about different themes to adopt and then finally decided to look at how understanding finance individually can lead to putting more money aside over a period of time. 
    Discussion around the project started on 20th January 2023with some basic sketche drawn using Balsamiq later updated as more suggestions were discussed.

    Question Pages:

    To be able to put aside some amount over a period of time, the user is asked about the different luxuries he spends on and then a randomisation is done to suggest to the user how he can cut down on them for his intended savings.

One of the team member provided the idea of looking at finance management through the individual rather than looking at the whole society at large. It sounded to us a beautiful idea and the team decided to put more together on it
